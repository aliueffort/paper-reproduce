In this repository, I reproduce the paper "Training-Based MIMO Channel Estimation, A study of Estimation Tradeoffs and optimal Training Signals".
If you need the code, feel free to use it and add the original paper as a reference.

The transmit power is set to 1 and change the signal-to-noise ratio through adjusting the noise power.
